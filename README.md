# Challenge_21

I decided to created a new cryptocurrency, KaseiCoin is a fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant. I launched a crowdsale that allows people to convert their money to KaseiCoin.

This token was minted by using a Crowdsale contract from OpenZeppelin Solidity library.

The crowdsale contract that I created manages the entire crowdsale process, allowing users to send ether to the contract and in return receive KCS, or KaseiCoin tokens. This contract will mint the tokens automatically and distribute them to buyers in one transaction.
